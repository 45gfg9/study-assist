### 「17」 Character

Given: `char c = '@';`, the value of expression `'A' <= c <= 'Z'` is ______.

??? note "Answer"

    `1`.

    To solve this problem you do not need to remember ASCII code. This problem is about operator precedence. The expression `'A' <= c <= 'Z'` is equivalent to `(('A' <= c) <= 'Z')`. No matter what the value of `c` is, the expression `('A' <= c)` will be evaluated to `1` or `0`, which is less than `'Z'`. Therefore, the value of the expression `'A' <= c <= 'Z'` is `1`.

    But in other problems you may need to remember some key ASCII codes:

    | Character | ASCII Code |
    | --------- | ---------- |
    | `'0'`     | `48`       |
    | `'A'`     | `65`       |
    | `'a'`     | `97`       |

    Upper case is prior to lower case. The difference between `'A'` and `'a'` is `32`. So if you want to convert a lowercase letter to uppercase, you can use `c - 32`. Or an easier way: `c - 'a' + 'A'`.

### 「16」 Overflow

For code below:

```c
unsigned short sht = 0;
sht--;
```

What will be the value of `sht` after the execution?

<div style="display: flex">
    <div style="width: 100%">A. -1</div>
    <div style="width: 100%">B. 65535</div>
    <div style="width: 100%">C. 32767</div>
    <div style="width: 100%">D. 65536</div>
</div>

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    B.

    Remember that `unsigned short` is an unsigned integer type, so it will not be negative. Instead, it will be the largest value of `unsigned short` type. The largest value of `unsigned short` type is `65535`, because `unsigned short` is 16-bit long.
